# Algorithm Design Projects

## Project 1
This project was about a water distribution system. We had to parse the csv data into valid C++ objects, and performs algorithms on them. We had to create algorithms for max flow for each city, check if all reservoirs could sustain the current water network, provide functions for altering and removal of pipelines or pumping stations, do comparisons in case of removals of pipes, among others. It allowed for development of skills in abstraction of real data and application of algorithms (flow algorithms in this case) to get relevant information.

## Project 2
Concerned the Travelling Salesman Problem. Proved, through brute-force, the need for heuristics, using a basic graph class. Had to develop our own heuristics for this problem, which allowed for more sensibility towards algorithm creation. We created already known heuristic implementations for the problem, and also created inovations of our own using algorithm principles.
